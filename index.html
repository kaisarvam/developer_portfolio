    <h3>I am Loki of Asgard, and I am burdened with glorious purpose.</h3>
    <p>Loki is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee, scripter Larry Lieber and penciller Jack Kirby. The character, which is based on the Norse deity of the same name, is the Asgardian "God of Mischief", the adopted son of Odin and the brother of the superhero Thor. Loki has been portrayed as both a supervillain and antihero.
    In 2009, Loki was ranked as IGN's eighth-greatest comic book villain of all time[1] and in 2014 was ranked again by IGN, this time as the fourth-greatest comic book villain of all time.[2] Tom Hiddleston portrays the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films Thor (2011), The Avengers (2012), Thor: The Dark World (2013), Thor: Ragnarok (2017), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019). Hiddleston returned to portray the role in the Disney+ series Loki (2021)</p>

    <h2>You were made to be ruled. In the end, you will always kneel.</h2>
    <p> After stealing the Tesseract during the events of Avengers: Endgame (2019), an alternate version of Loki is brought to the mysterious Time Variance Authority (TVA), a bureaucratic organization that exists outside of time and space and monitors the timeline. They give Loki a choice: face being erased from existence due to being a "time variant", or help fix the timeline and stop a greater threat. Loki ends up trapped in his own crime thriller, traveling through time and altering human history</p>
